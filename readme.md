# Cheap computing

Because most cheap computers suck, but some of these ideas might help you get one that fits your needs. References to good used computers, singleboard computers, cheap components that can make old machines run better, I hope that *you* find something here that fits *your* needs, because *you* know better than me when it comes to *your* needs.

## Singleboard computers

Singleboard computers are headless devices that often run on ARM processors. They are great, because they're cheap, and most of them provide their own RAM and network controllers. The Raspberry Pi is the most popular of them and costs from $5 to $35, depending on the model, and only requires a standard USB power supply as well as an SD card to operate.

You can use them as cheap home servers, media servers, seedboxes or homemade NAS, and some of them are actually suitable for desktop use and might even support Windows 10.

## Used laptops

Used business class laptops are widely underrated. Computers that once came at a $1k+ price tag can be afforded at one fifth of their original price, if not less. They might not be as performant as their contemporary equivalents, but they are often way faster than what you can get at the same price point on the firsthand market, but with a huge bonus : they are still *built* like $1k+ computers, if not better.

These machines are suitable for daily use like web browsing, development, and sometimes 3D or audio production. Video production might be out of reach for these devices sadly, unless you're patient...

## Components

You just got a used laptop, any basic task feels slow and sluggish and by the time you fire up a web browser your battery just died ? That was to be expected when you bought a computer with a 10 y/o mechanical drive. Good news however, you might still be able to find a new, bigger battery and SATA 3.0 (600MB/s) came out in 2008, so adding an SSD to that beast is far from a stupid idea.

Older computers feel slower mostly because of mechanical drive's (HDD) terrible latency. Getting an SSD not only will make it *fly*, but it will also grant it a few more minutes on battery as it is less power hungry. If that's not enough, you might consider replacing its old, worn battery with a beefier, unused one.

## Software

Slow hardware isn't the only reason why everything seems too slow on your PC. Software got way heavier and now even chat apps have loading screens.

Thankfully, some people *do* care about your resources and so should you because wasting all your **time** and your CPU's *power hungry* cycles on a fancy loading animation is absolutely *shameful*.
